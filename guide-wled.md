# User Manual

HassLight LED Controller let you connect LED strip to your smart home, and control it via "Siri" or "Alexa" or any other smart speakers connected to Home Assistant. 

For now we support three ways of integrating. 
1. Connect with Apple HomeKit (iOS Home APP)
2. Connect with Home Assistant
3. Connect with WLED (WLED APP for iOS and Android, Alexa, MQTT etc.) 

By default, it comes with the HomeKit based firmware to interact with iOS Home APP.
We also made it quite easy to flash the MQTT based firmware, in order to interact with Home Assistant. And of course you can switch the integration ways back and forth. See [Flash firmware](flash).
